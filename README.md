# Breast cancer classification

Breast cancer classification using machine learning techniques has become an essential area of research for improving early detection and diagnosis. This project focuses on developing a reliable model that can accurately differentiate between malignant and benign breast tumors.

In this breast cancer classification project, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was employed to develop an accurate model for distinguishing between malignant and benign breast tumors.
