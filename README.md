# Breast cancer classification

Breast cancer classification using machine learning techniques has become an essential area of research for improving early detection and diagnosis. This project focuses on developing a reliable model that can accurately differentiate between malignant and benign breast tumors.

In this breast cancer classification project, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was employed to develop an accurate model for distinguishing between malignant and benign breast tumors.

The dataset used comprises 569 cases, with 212 cases labeled as malignant and 357 cases labeled as benign. The dataset consists of 30 features, including mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, mean area, mean smoothness, mean compactness, mean concavity, and mean concave points, among others.
